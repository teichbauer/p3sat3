process description
=====================
C001-C037.txt  is the whole coverage for C001, C002,...C037
there exist for sats: 162, 226, 234

step1: split bit-7, so that there are 2 parts of the value range: 
A: [0..127]
B: [128..255]
the klauses kset-A, with bit-7 = 0, are for A, but not B
the klauses kset-B, with bit-7 = 1, are for B, but not A
all other klauses kset-S without bit-7 bit set, are in both A and B
